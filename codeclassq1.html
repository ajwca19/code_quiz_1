    <hr></div>
    <p class="bodypara">On the first day of coding class,
    we learned that HTML and CSS are used
    for the structure and styling of a website.
    We learned how to make headings, like the one 
    above the horizontal rule, and how to make the
    title of the page.</p>
    <p class="bodypara">On the second day of
    coding class, we learned how to make cool things, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bold Text</b></li>
      <li><i>Italic Text</i></li>
      <li><sup>Super Script</sup></li>
      <li><sub>Sub Script</sub></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodypara">We also learned how to put in images and colors for our webpages.</p>
    <p class="bodypara">On our third day of coding class, we learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank">links</a>, which are called anchors in HTML.</p>

    <p class="bodypara">Not those anchors! These anchors send you somewhere else on the web, like here: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-33335342" target="_blank">Click Here</a>. It looks like the United States and Cuba are working together well now, just like us!</p>

    <p class="bodypara">That's just some of the stuff we learned in coding class, so stay tuned for more!</p>
